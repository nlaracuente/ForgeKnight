# Forge Knight
Is our entry for the [Ludum Dare 43 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/forgeknight) where the theme was about "Sacrifices must be made."\
I have only included the scripts as those are owned by me.

## Description
Your kingdom is being invaded by a herd of Orcs and is it up to your trusty Knight and his team of an Archer an a Mage to put a end to this madness.

## Play
- You can [Click Here](https://prodigalson.itch.io/frogeknight) to play 
- Support for Windows Desktop and Browser is provided

## Tools
- Unity
- Photoshop

## Note
Due to a two nasty bugs that took longer than I wanted to only to have me remove the feature all together, shouldâ€™ve stop sooner -lol, I did not have time to update formulas and balance the game. I do aim to continue to work on the game and improve on its design but that will be part of a separate repo.
